## Interactive data visualization
Aim to use python plotly, dash and functions in jupyter NBextensions to create smarter data visualizations and design dashboards that can be useful for business decision making or personal interests. 

### Dashboard with python dash and plotly
"Interactive dash charts.py" uses a world situation dataset with indicators in various aspects and creates interactive graphs with dropdowns, slider, radiobuttons and hover reaction on plots. Figure 1 shows the output.

### Play with jupyter widgets
Jupyter widgets help build interactive GUIs for notebooks and it can be extremely useful facing with simple sales analysis in different dimension such as product category, different kpi measure and top products selection. Rather than using excel to repeat the filter, ordering, category selection operations again and again, smart widgets functions can help you get the result under a certain selection criteria for different dimensions just by selecting in the offered dropdowns. 

Here's an example, the output allows the user to get the top 4 products which are within the superior category "食品大类", in terms of "huanbi" KPI and are also within the inferior category "冲调饮料" which ranks the fourth in terms of sales in "食品大类".

In notebook "sales report with widgets.ipynb", a real business case is used to analysis sales performance in different aspects. The data is not included out of confidential reasons.
